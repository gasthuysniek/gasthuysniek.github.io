				<h2>Graphical representations</h2>
				A user can request the desired graphics for his data in the story. To enhance the user experience, the
				various graphics have been divided into the following categories.
				<br><br>
				<strong>VDT</strong><br>
				This graphic shows how the hierarchy between the different accounts is structured.
				<br><br>
				<strong>Table</strong><br>
				This graphical representation allows a user to schedule FTE values.
				<br><br>
				<strong> Treshholds</strong><br>
				Tresholds can be set in the planning model. These indicate intervals between which values can lie. The
				current intervals are set that when an account goes below 0, one enters the interval warning of the
				tresholds.
				These tresholds are displayed using bullet charts.
				<br><br>
				<strong>GeoMap</strong><br>
				A planning model can be built in two ways. One is to start directly from a flat file (Excel) and extract
				the dimensions in the model directly from there. This way of working makes it possible to create the
				GeoMap graphic representation by geo-enriching the data (assigning longitude and latitude to a
				location).

				Best practices indicate that it is better to create a blank model. This way, one first defines the
				dimensions and then uploads the data. However, the scope SAC does not allow Geo-Enrichment when creating
				a blank model.

				In SAP Analytics Cloud, one can create Custom Widgets (JavaScript code that can be imported into SAC).
				Using these custom widgets, one can create this graphical representation and do geo-enrichment. This was
				not in the scope of the internship so other functionalities were given priority.
				<br><br>
				<strong>Comparison Charts</strong><br>
				This category contains graphical representations with which values in the data set can be compared.
				<br><br>
				<strong>Trend charts</strong><br>
				This category includes graphics that can be used to identify trends in the data.
				<br><br>
				<strong>Distribution charts</strong><br>
				This category includes graphical representations that can be used to show the distribution of data.
				<br><br>
				<strong>Correlation charts</strong><br>
				This category contains graphical representations that allow the interrelationship of the data to be
				viewed.
				<br><br>
				<strong>Indicator charts</strong><br>
				This category includes the bullet chart and the numeric point. In the bullet chart, the treshholds of
				the model can be displayed and with the numeric point, a value based on the filtering can be requested.
				<br><br>
				<strong>More</strong><br>
				In this category you will find the graphics: Donut, Marimekko and Pie chart.
				<br><br>
				<h2>Filtering </h2>
				A user can also apply filtering to the data in the story. Two types of filters are provided.
				<br>
				This allows a user to filter the graphics in a particular category.
				<br>
				A user can apply filtering to the entire story. This is done by selecting the desired filter at the top
				of the dashboard.
				<br><br>
				<h2>Planningsfunctionalities</h2><br>
				In addition to the graphical representations, a user can also schedule FTE (full-time equivalent)
				values. This can be done directly in the table.
				You can find them in the following way.
				<br>
				Startpage -> Dropdown menu -> Table

			<h2>User interface</h2><br>
			In order to increase the ease of use and workflow of the application, a user can perform the following
			functionalities.
			<br><br>
			A user can hide or show fields for transferring data (for more information see chapter application ->
			planning functionality: transferring data) by using the hide/show button via the following path.
			Startpage -> button “hide/show”.
			<br><br>

			A user can apply filtering to the application (see chapter application -> filtering). To enhance the user
			experience, a user can reset the table's initial filters in the following way:
			Startpage -> button “RestoreFilters”
			<br><br>
			<h2>Filtering</h2><br>
			A user can apply filtering to the table. This can be achieved in two ways.
			One can filter directly in the application in the following way
			<br><br>
			Startpage -> button “Filter” -> input the desired filtering -> button “Ok”.
			<br><br>
			A user can also cancel the filtering by clicking on the cancel button in the pop-up.
			<br><br>
			A second way that a user can apply filtering to the table is with the chatbot (see chapter chatbot ->
			filtering table).
			<br><br>

			<h2>Planningsfunctionality: transfer data</h2><br>
			A user can also choose to transfer the data to another date. For example, he can choose to transfer all FTE
			values from 2019 to 2020. However, a user cannot plan in the past and therefore cannot plan the above use
			case. He can cancel the action at any time via the cancel button in the pop-ups.
			<br><br>
			A user can choose to transfer the complete dataset in the following way:
			<br><br>
			Homepage -> "Transfer All" button
			A user can also choose to transfer only the data for a specific year. This can be done in the following
			ways:
			<br><br>
			Start page -> "Date transfer" button -> in the pop-up, enter only the desired years -> "transfer on time"
			button.
			<br><br>
			Or
			<br><br>
			In the application, fill in the fields "from" and "to" and click on the button "transfer on time".
			<br><br>
			A user can also choose not to transfer the data of all cost centres for a specific year, but for 1 specific
			cost centre. He can do this in the same way, but fill in the input fields for company code and cost centre
			and click on the button "full input transfer".
			<br><br>


			<h2>Planningsfunctionality: transfer endbalance</h2><br>
			<strong>Transfer all the endbalance values</strong><br>
			A user can also choose to transfer the endbalance of each cost centre to the opening balance of the
			following months. He can do this in the following ways:
			<br><br>
			Startpage -> button "CarryAllEndBalance".
			<br><br>
			Or
			<br><br>
			By using the chatbot (see chapter chatbot -> transfer endbalance)
			<br><br>
			A user can also transfer a final balance for a specific cost centre in a specific company. He can do this in
			the following way:
			<br><br>
			Startpage -> button "CarrySpecificEndBalance" -> fill in the desired input in the pop-up -> OK
			<br><br>
			<strong>Planningsfunctionality: Planning FTE value</strong><br>
			A user can also directly schedule FTE values in the table. He cannot schedule values in the past and not on
			the opening balance.

			<h2>Introduction</h2><br>
			In addition to performing planning functionalities directly in the story and application, a user can also do
			this with the help of the chatbot. Below, the different functionalities are explained and how a user can
			execute them. There is also a clear overview of the different commands. At the end it is explained how a
			user can customise the chatbot and control its own functionalities.
			<br><br>
			A chatbot must be trained, built and connected. Training the chatbot relates to learning intents that a user
			can perform. Building the chatbot relates to dealing with these intents and how the chatbot should deal with
			them. In the implementations, this is where the webhook is configured that establishes communication between
			both technologies. In addition, the chatbot is also connected which consists of a conversational AI web
			client connection.
			<br><br>
			The chatbot makes use of an algorithm called NLP (Natural Language Processing). This algorithm ensures that
			the chatbot assigns the intent that most closely matches the sentence. These intents contain entities which
			will become our usable data in SAP Analytics Cloud. This allows the chatbot to recognise similar commands
			and allows it to be flexible with errors, among other things.
			<br><br>
			Finally, a user can also monitor interactions with the chatbot.
			<br><br>
			<h2>Planning FTE Values</h2>
			A user can schedule FTE values just like in the story and the application. The chatbot is trained to do this
			using the intent "fteinputtask". A user can perform this scheduling functionality with the chatbot using the
			command below:
			<br><br>
			<i>Add 5 FTE for account Function for 202302 for company AT11 for cost center AT11_9302.</i><br>
			<br>
			From the above command, the chatbot extracts the following entities:
			<br><br>
			FTEValue, Account, Date, CompanyCodeId, CostCenterNumber
			<br><br>
			<h2>Filtering table</h2><br>
			A user can filter the table just like in the story and application. The chatbot is trained to do this using
			the intent "filtertable". A user can perform this scheduling function with the chatbot using the command
			below:
			<br><br>
			<i>filter table on account OpeningBalance for company AT11 for costcenter AT11_9302 for 2019</i><br>
			<br>
			From the above command, the chatbot extracts the following entities:
			<br><br>
			Account, CompanyCodeId, CostCenterNumber, Date.

			<h2>Transfer endbalance</h2><br>
			A user can transfer the final balance in the table to the next month. He can do this for one specific cost
			centre but also for all cost centres for a specific year.
			<br><br>
			The chatbot is trained to transfer all the end balances by means of the intent "transferallendbalance" and
			can be executed by a user with the command below:
			<i>Transfer all the end balance values to the next month.</i><br>
			The chatbot recognises this sentence and this intent is passed to SAC. No entities need to be derived from
			this command.
			<br><br>
			The user can also use the chatbot to transfer the end balance for one specific cost centre at a certain
			time. The chatbot is trained for this using the intent "transfer specific balance". A user can perform this
			functionality by using the command below:
			<i>transfer the endbalance for company AT11 for costcenter AT11_9302 from 2019</i>
			<br>
			From the above command, the chatbot retrieves the following entities:
			<br><br>
			CompanyCodeId, CostCenterNumber, Date.
			<br><br>
			<h2>Transfer data</h2><br>

			A user can use the chatbot to transfer data to another period. He can choose to do this for all costcenters
			or 1 specific costcenter, just like directly in the application. The chatbot is trained to do this using the
			intent "transfer data".
			<br><br>
			A user can execute the planning function to transfer all costcenters for a specific date by using the
			command below:
			<br><br>
			<i>Trasfer FTE Values for from 2020 to 2021</i><br><br>
			<br>
			From the above command, the chatbot extracts the following entities:
			<br><br>
			Date
			<br><br>
			A user can execute the scheduling function to transfer the values of 1 costcenter on a certain date by using
			the command below:
			<br><br>
			<i>Trasfer 5 FTE for account New Function for company AT11 for cost center AT11_9302 from 2020 to
				2021</i><br>
				<br>
				From the above command, the chatbot extracts the following entities:
			<br><br>
			Date, CostCenterNumber, CompanyCodeId.
			<br><br>
			<h2>Graphical representations</h2><br>
			Within SAP Analytics Cloud, data can be presented in many different ways using graphical representations. In
			order to make the right selection and choose the most suitable graphics, a communication standard called
			IBCS is applied. This standard determines which graphics are the most suitable to get the message across as
			efficiently as possible. The purpose is to find out the state of the company and how this can be done, and
			which graphics are chosen to do this, can be found below.
			<br><br>
			When a user wants to show the evolution of an account, a time series will be chosen as graphic. The chatbot
			is trained to do this using the intent "timeseries". A user can perform this functionality by using the
			following command:
			<br><br>
			<i>Give me the evolution over time for account Netchange for company AT11 for date 2019 for costcenter
				AT11_9302</i><br><br>
			From the above command, the chatbot retrieves the following entities:
			<br><br>
			Account, CompanyCodeId, CostCenterNumber, Date
			<br><br>
			When a user wants to retrieve one particular value and display it on a graph, this is done using a numeric
			point. For this purpose the chatbot is trained using the intent "numericpoint". The user can perform this
			functionality by using the following command:
			<br><br>
			<i>Amount of account EndBalance for 2019 for company AT11 for cost centre AT11_9302</i>
			<br>
			From the above command, the chatbot retrieves the following entities:
			<br><br>
			Account, CompanyCodeId, CostCenterNumer, Date
			<br><br>
			When the user wants to see the relationship between the various accounts, a Waterfall Chart is chosen as the
			graphical representation. The chatbot is trained for this using the intent "givewaterfall". A user can
			invoke this functionality by using the command below:
			<i>Show me the correlation of the accounts</i><br>
			The chatbot recognises this sentence and this intent is passed to SAC. No entities need to be derived from
			this command.
			<br><br>
			<h2>Resetting original filters</h2><br>

			A user can choose to restore the original filters of the table not by using the button but by using the
			chatbot. The chatbot is trained to do this using the intent "restoreoriginalfilter". The user can invoke
			this functionality by using the command below:
			<i>Restore the original Filter values</i><br>
			The chatbot recognises this sentence and this intent is passed to SAC. No entities should therefore be
			derived from this command.
			<br><br>
			<h2>Greeting the chatbot</h2><br>
			In addition to performing the planning functions, filtering the table and retrieving graphics, a user can
			also greet the chatbot.
